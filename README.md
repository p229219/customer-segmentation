# customer-segmentation

## The Challenges:
*The dataset is a customer database of a mall. It contains 200 observations with basic information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The purpose of this analysis is to uncover underlying patterns in the customer base, and to groups of customers accordingly, often known as market segmentation. In doing so, the marketing team can have a more targeted approach to reach consumers, and the mall can make more informed strategic decisions to increase profits.*

## Data:
This project is a part of the Mall Customer Segmentation Data competition held on Kaggle.
The dataset can be downloaded from the kaggle website which can be found https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python.

## Apporach:
Understanding the data.

Perform elbow method to find optimal no. of clustering

Training a model using unsupervised machine learning

Plotting the cluster 

Plotting the 3d model .

Conclusions


## Understanding the data:
 #### **Basic understanding**:
 The most common ways in which businesses segment their customer base are:

   ###### ***Demographic information*** : 
  such as gender, age, familial and marital status, income, education, and occupation.
   
   ##### ***Geographical information***:
   which differs depending on the scope of the company. For localized businesses, this info might pertain to specific towns or counties. For larger                       companies, it might mean a customerâ€™s city, state, or even country of residence.
  
  ##### ***Psychographics***: 
   such as social class, lifestyle, and personality traits.
   
   #### ***Behavioral data***: 
   such as spending and consumption habits, product/service usage, and desired benefits
   
  #### **Advantages of Customer Segmentation**:
  > Price Optimization
   
  > Enhances competitivness
   
  > Brand Awarness
 
  > Acquistion and Retention
 
  > Increase Revenue and ROI
  
 ## **Main Understanding**:
 ***The main components of this project are exploratory data analysis and model building***.
 ### libraries required :
 
 ##### Pandas
 
 ##### Numpy
 
 ##### Matplotlib
 
 ##### Seaborn
 
 ##### Scikit-learn
 
## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis:
#### In this section we are doing a little bit of data exploration, checking for null values, object data types and other things we might consider in order to keep our data clean and well structured

##### Here we have the following features :

######  1. CustomerID: ***It is the unique ID given to a customer***
###### 2. Gender: ***Gender of the customer***
###### 3. Age: ***The age of the customer***
###### 4. Annual Income(k$): ***It is the annual income of the customer***
###### 5. Spending Score: ***It is the score(out of 100) given to a customer by the mall authorities, based on the money spent and the behavior of the customer.***

#### ***We have zero null values in any column***
